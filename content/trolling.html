          <p>The forum of rage bait has been used for ideological and political gain. Not to bring up Libs of Tiktok, but Libs of Tiktok was an extremely popular twitter account that reposted content from left leaning and LGBT creators with derogatory commentary to incite outrage in her conservative follower base. Videos and commentary posted on the account lead to real people and institutions being threatened with violence.</p>

          <p>Aside from the more obvious links, inflammatory statements meant to incite rage shift the Overton window to allow more vitriolic, but sincere hate speech into the public forum. “It’s just a joke, officer” is not quite an adequate defense for yelling “fire” in a crowded theater. </p>

          <p>I’ll admit to finding the occasional rage bait post funny. Watching people swallow hook line and sinker whole can inspire digital schadenfreude paired with a finely aged bottle of intellectual superiority but it can often cause very real harm.</p>

          <p>So why is it so pervasive? Posts successfully farming interactions online are paid in a percentage of ad revenue by the social media company, because social media companies make ad revenue off posts that increase user retention and engagement. It is financially in their best interest to promote interaction bait, the more outrageous, the better. Between that and the cost inherent in content moderation it is unlikely that these posts are going to diminish by the hand of social media conglomerates. But they can disappear by the hand of YOU.</p>
