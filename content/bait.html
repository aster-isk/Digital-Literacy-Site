      <h2>DEFINITION</h2>
      <div class="pair">
        <div class="text">
          <p>Interaction bait, like clickbait, is a way to farm interactions on social media. Liking, commenting,
            sharing, watch time, and anything else that fits in a youtuber’s call to action are up for grabs. But, hey, most social media posts you come across in the wild are seeking attention- what makes these any
            different?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content"></div>
      </div>
      <div class="pair">
        <div class="text">
          <p>Well, these posts aren’t exactly... prolific or informative. I’m not sure most of them qualify as artistic
            expression either. There is no meaning, hidden or otherwise. Interaction bait exists exclusively to convince
            you to at least open the comments and scroll a bit.</p>

      <h2>ANATOMY</h2>
      <div class="pair">
        <div class="text">
          <p>The majority of it is harmless, but bait can use some manipulative techniques to get you to pay attention.
          </p>
          <p>The content is often confusing, provoking, and bizarre. After all, comments and sharing are the most
            meaningful form of engagement- so creating something so weird that you have to send it to your friends is
            one for the playbooks.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content"></div>
      </div>
      <div class="pair">
        <div class="text">
          <p>Do you think that this recipe is used by, well, anyone? Will anyone ever do this genuinely and eat this
            genuinely? Or will you save it and cross post it to your discord because it’s almost unsettling watching an
            entire menu be agglomerated into an awful chimeric mass of diner food.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content"></div>
      </div>
      <div class="pair">
        <div class="text">
          <p>You also have posts with calls to action- often preying on sensitive topics, like spirituality and social
            identities. By the way- send this page to your friends if you love puppies. And if you’re neutral about
            puppies, or even if you hate puppies send this page to your friends anyway!</p>

      <h2>WHY</h2>
      <div class="pair">
        <div class="text">
          <p>Why go out of your way to make these videos? Money of course! Lots of social media sites allow for ad
            revenue sharing, where creators get a cut of a platform’s ad revenue based on how much interaction and
            retention their posts generate. If a post gets a lot of attraction, advertisers might pay you to pin an
            advertisement of their product in the comments. If you’ve ever clicked on the replies of a very popular,
            often mundane tweet you’ve probably been subjected to a reply advertising a lamp or something that was
            definitely not drop shipped. You could also promote your Venmo and Cash App in the comments of your post if
            you really feel like being slimy about it. (This works best if you frame it as charity or tithings under
            your AI Generated Jesus post.)</p>
